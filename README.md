This is my first Website! I made this website in an attempt to impress employers the day before a career fair, and tried to learn html and javascript and created this during an all nighter. 
Then I didn't have enough time to figure out how to host it and it didn't look too great anyways, so I left it as was and moved on to school work and sleep.
This project is my first attempt to use GitHub and Git on an individual level, and my guinea pig for using GitHub on my own home machine terminal!
